# frankenphp tags are of the format {frankenphp_version}-php{php_version}
# It should be noted that besides frankenphp and php, this image may also
# contain updates of other "below rail" type dependancies like Caddy and Mercure.
# Therefore besides the obvious testing, basically anything configured in the Caddyfile
# should be tested against new versions of the frankenphp image before deploying to prod
